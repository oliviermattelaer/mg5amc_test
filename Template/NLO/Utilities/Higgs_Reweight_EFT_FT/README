This folder contains the files needed to reweight Higgs events
generated in the EFT to the full theory. To use it do the following.

1. Generate a process in the Higgs EFT. For example

import model HC_NLO_X0_UFO-heft
define p = p b b~
define j = p
generate p p > x0 /t [QCD] @0
add process p p > x0 j /t [QCD] @1
output
exit

2. Write a correct processes.dat file (containing all the relevant
flavour structures contributing to the above process) and put it in
the <YourProcess>/SubProcesses/ directory.

3. Copy the write_proc_library_and_wrapper.f from here to the
<YourProcess>/SubProcesses/ directory, compile it with

gfortran -o write_proc_library_and_wrapper write_proc_library_and_wrapper.f

and execute it

./write_proc_library_and_wrapper

This reads the processes.dat file and creates the ML5lib_reweight
directory containing all the files relevant for the reweighting. It
also compiles the MadLoop library.

4. Launch the event generation using the "-l" (or "--reweight_with_loop") option,
i.e. from the <YourProcess>/ directory:

./bin/generate_events -l

Note that this option is also very useful in relation with the '-r'
(or '--reweightonly') option.


This will give you an event file where the default weight is still the
EFT, but all the weights between the <rwgt> and </rwgt> tags contain
information from the full theory.
