This folder ("VetoPrefactors/") which contains the various ingredients
for the resummation using scheme A as described in arXiv:1412.8408
[hep-ph].

The Files AnomalyAndH.f BeamCorr.f and mstwpdf.f contain the
subroutines to each reweighting factor. Further the Grid files of the
PDFs and beam Functions are in the folder Grids. In "parameters.inc"
some parameters used in the files are included. 

To use:

* Generate a LO event file (but using the NLO process generation),
and unzip it once it is done.

* Make sure to set the ickkw parameter to -1 in the run_card and use
  the MSTW2008nnlo PDF set (lhapdf code is 21200) before the
  generation of the event file.

* Put this folder (as a subfolder of) the Events/run_XXX/ directory.

* Move the virt_reweighter.py and resum_reweighter.py files to the
bin/internal/ directory.

* From the bin/internal/ directory, execute

./virt_reweighter.py ../../Events/run_XXX/events.lhe
./resum_reweighter.py ../../Events/run_XXX/events_rwgt.lhe

and you should get the event file with weights that are
LO+NNLL(jet-veto) correct. The veto and scales can be changed in the
resum_driver.f file, and it is only needed to re-run the
resum_reweighter (not the virt_reweighter)

In the include file JetVetoParameters.inc the reweighting parameters
(such as jet definition parameters) can be changed.
