# DECAY CHANNELS
# Write down decay channels for the resonances, to be performed by the shower.
# Up to 99 decay channels are supported. Three-body decays are supported.
# Branching ratios are used only by HERWIG6, and correctly understood only if
# they add up to 1, and if up to 3 decay channels per resonance are required.
# Example of syntax for Z -> e+ e- and Z -> mu+ mu-, with BR = 0.5 each, and for
# H -> tau+ tau-, with BR = 1:
# DM_1 = 23 > -11 11 @ 0.5d0
# DM_2 = 23 > -13 13 @ 0.5d0
# DM_3 = 25 > -15 15 @ 1.0d0

# be in the HWAnalyzer/ (or PYAnalyzer/) folder. 
# Please use files in those folders as examples.
