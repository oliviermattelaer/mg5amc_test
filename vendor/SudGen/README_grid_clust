Here we report the operations to run parallel pretabulations on lxplus

1) make gridsudgen_clust

2) edit run_gridsudgen.sh with the desired input parameters

3) ./condor_submit_gridsudgen.sh
this step submits jobs on lxplus; at the end of the jobs one gets
files called grid_i_j.txt (i=itype, j=ipart)

4) make gridsudcomb

5) ./gridsudcomb < input
where 'input' must have the same parameters as those used in
run_gridsudgen.sh
this step copies the content of the grid_i_j.txt files to
the final sudakov.f output file
