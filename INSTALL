************************************************************

Dependencies :
===============

 * MadGraph5_aMC@NLO *

- Python 3.7 (or higher, python2.7 is also working for the time being)

 * MadEvent *
Package for the LO cross-section computation and generation of events 

- bash
- perl 5.8 (or higher)
- a Fortran 77 compiler (such as g77 or gfortran)
- a c++ compiler 

 * aMC@NLO *
Package for the NLO cross-section computation (matched to shower) and
generation of events 

- bash
- gfortran4.6 (or higher) compatible with quadruple precision)
- a c++ compiler
- other dependencies (for loop) will be installed at run time the first time that you need it.

On Windows:
===========

In order to run MG5 you need to
1) add the Python directory to the PATH
2) run $> python ./bin/mg5_aMC

Note that most of the output (including madevent/aMCatNLO)
are not compatible with Windows. We do recomend to use unix subsystem.
The old cygwin was never supported.

For Post-processing/optional package:
=====================================

From MG5aMC, you can run a lot of post-processing script to plot, shower,
decay, ... your generated sample. Those tools need to be installed in
advance via the MG5aMC terminal thanks to the "install" command.
If some of those packages are already present, you can edit the file
./input/mg5_configuration.txt to uncomment the associated line and
indicate the path to the package.
