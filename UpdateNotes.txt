Update notes for MadGraph 5 (in reverse time order)

1.3.30 (18/11/11) OM: Fix a bug for the instalation of pythia-pgs on a 64 bit
       		      UNIX machine.
		  OM: If ROOTSYS is define but root in the PATH, add it 
		      automatically in create_matching_plots.sh
		      This is require for the UIUC cluster.

1.3.29 (16/11/11) OM: Fixed particle identities in the Feynman diagram drawing
                  JA: Fixed bug in pdf reweighting when external LHAPDF is used.
                  OM+JA: Simplify the compilation of pythia-pgs package.

1.3.28 (14/11/11) OM+JA: Fix special case when Lorentz structure combining
                      two different Majorana particles depends on the
                      incoming/outgoing status of the Majorana particles
                      (needed for MSSM with Goldstino).
                  JA: Fixed problem with colors in addmothers.f for complicated
                      multiparticle vertices and simplified color treatment 
                      (thanks to Gauthier Durieux for pointing this out).
                  JA: Further improved gridpack parameters
                  OM: Update the parallel test (now testing against MG5 1.3.3)
                  OM: Include some parallel test in the release script.


1.3.27 (05/11/11) JA: Fix bug in mirrored amplitudes (sometimes
                      amplitudes that should not be flagged as
                      mirrored were flagged as mirrored). Thanks
                      Marco Zaro for reporting this!
                  JA: Fix another problem getting enough events in
                      gridpack mode (it was not completely fixed in
                      v. 1.3.24). Thanks Alexis!
                  JA: Added "!" comments for all parameters in the default
                      run_card, since apparently this is still needed
                      for g77 to correctly read the parameters.
 
1.3.26 (31/10/11) JA: Fix color setting in MadEvent event file for
                      multiparticle vertices, which was not taken into
                      account in the upgrade in v. 1.3.18
                  OM: Fixed mmnl cut (inv. mass of all leptons and neutrinos)
                      which was never active.
                  OM: Fix td install in Linux were a chmod was missing

1.3.25 (27/10/11) JA: Ensure that the correct intermediate resonance
                      is always written in the event file, even when we
                      have resonances with identical properties.
                  OM: Fix the bug forcing to quit the web browse in order to
                      have MG5 continuing to run.
                  OM: Change the tutorial in order to allow open index.html
                      after the output command. 
 
1.3.24 (22/10/11) JA: Fix problem with getting enough events in gridpack
                      mode (this was broken in v. 1.3.11 when we moved
                      from events to luminocity in refine). Thanks to
                      Alexis Kalogeropoulos.

1.3.23 (19/10/11) JA: Allow user to set scales using setscales.f again 
                      (this was broken in v. 1.3.18). Thanks to Arindam Das.
                  JA: Ensure that the error message is displayed if the
                     "make" command is not installed on the system.
 
1.3.22 (12/10/11) JA: Fixed another bug (also introduced in 1.3.18), which 
                      could give the wrong ordering between the s-channel 
                      propagators for certain multiprocess cases (this
                      also lead to a hard stop, so don't worry, if you get 
                      your events, the bug doesn't affect you). Sorry about
                      that, this is what happens when you add a lot of
                      new functionality...

1.3.21 (12/10/11) OM: Add a new command: install.
                      This allow to install quite easily different package
                      devellop for Madgraph/MadEvent. The list of available
                      package are pythia-pgs/MadAnalysis/ExRootAnalysis/Delphes
                  OM: Adding TopEffth Model
                  OM: Improve display particles and autocompletion in
                      presence of nonpropagating particles
                  OM: Fix Aloha bug linked to four fermion operator
                  PA: fix the problem of degenerate color basis in the
                      diquark sextet model
                  JA: Fixed bug in cluster.f that created a hard stop,
                      introduced in 1.3.18.

1.3.20 (09/10/11) JA: Fixed bug in myamp.f that created a hard stop
                      error for certain cases with many processes with
                      different propagators in the same subprocess dir.

1.3.19 (06/10/11) JA: Fixed problem with SubProcesses makefile on Linux,
                      introduced in 1.3.18.

1.3.18 (04/10/11) JA: Use model information to determine color of particles
                      for reweighting and propagator color info.
                  JA: Changed the definition of "forbidden s-channels"
                      denoted by "$" to exclude on-shell s-channels while
                      keeping all diagrams (i.e., complemetary to the decay
                      chain formalism). This reduces the problems with 
                      gauge invariance compared to previously.
                      "Onshell" is as usual defined by the "bwcutoff" flag 
                      in the run_card.dat.
                  JA: Enable proper 4-flavor matching (such as gg>hbb~+jets)
                      Note that you need the Pythia/PGS package v. 2.1.9 or 
                      later to use with 4F matching.
                      Changes include: alpha_s reweighting also for b vertices,
                      new scale treatment (mu_F for pp>hbb~ is (pT_b^max*m_Th)),
                      no clustering of gluons to final-state massive particles
                      in MadEvent.
                  JA: Ensure that factorization scale settings and matching works
                      also in singlet t-channel exchange processes like
                      single top and VBF. The dynamic factorization
                      scale is given by the pT of the scattered quark
                      (on each side of the event).
                Note: You need the Pythia/PGS package v. 2.1.10 or later
                      to use with VBF matching, to ensure that both radiated
                      and scattered partons are treated correctly
                      - scattered partons need to be excluded from the matching,
                      since their pT can be below QCUT. An even better
                      treatment would require to individually shower and match
                      the two sides in Pythia, which is not presently possible.
                Note: In the matched 4-flavor process p p > t b~ j $ w+ w- t~ +
                      p p > t b~ j j $ w+ w- t~, there is an admixture
                      of t-channel single top (with up to 1 radiated jet) 
                      and s-channel single top (with up to 2 radiated jets). 
                      In this case, the automatic determination of maximum 
                      multiplicity sample doesn't work (since max in the file 
                      will be 2 jets, but for t-channel max is 1 jet).
                      So MAXJETS=1 must be specified in the pythia_card.dat.
                  JA: Fixed pdf reweighting for matching, which due to a mistake
                      had never been activated.
                  JA: Improved phase space integration presetting further by 
                      taking into account special cuts like xpt, ht etc.
                  JA: Introduce new convention for invariant mass cuts
                      - if max < min, exclude intermediate range
                      (allows to exclude W/Z dijet resonances in VBF processes)

1.3.17 (30/09/11) OM: Fix a crash created by ALOHA when it tries to create the full
                      set of ALOHA routines (pythia8 output only).

1.3.16 (11/09/11) JA: Fixed the problem from 1.3.12.

1.3.15 (09/09/11) OM: remove the fix of 1.3.12
                      (No events in output for some given processes)

1.3.14 (08/09/11) OM: Fix a bug in the RS model introduced in 1.3.8

1.3.13 (05/09/11) JA: Fixed bug with cut_decays=F which removed cuts also for
                      non-decay products in certain channels if there is
                      a forced decay present. Note that this does not affect
                      xqcut, only pt, minv and eta cuts.
                  JA: If non-zero phase space cutoff, don't use minimum of
                      1 GeV (this allows to go to e.g. 2m_e invariant mass for
                      \gamma* > e+ e-).

1.3.12 (01/09/11) JA: Fixed problem with decay chains when different decays
                      result in identical final states, such as
                      p p > go go, (go > b1/b1~ b/b~, b1/b1~ > b/b~ n1)
                      (only one of the decay chains was chosen, instead of
                      all 3 combinations (b1,b1), (b1,b1~), (b1~,b1~))
                  JA: Allow for overall orders also with grouped subprocesses
                  JA: Ensure that only leading color flows are included in event
                      output (so no singlet flows from color octets).
                  JA: Fixed small bug in fermion flow determination for multifermion
                      vertices.

1.3.11 (26/08/11) JA: Improved precision of "survey" by allowing 4th and 5th 
                      iteration if accuracy after 3 iterations < 10%.
                  JA: Subdivide BW in phase space integration for conflicting BWs 
                      also for forced decays, to improve generation with large
                      bwcutoff in e.g. W+ W- production with decays.
                  JA: Do refine using luminocity instead of number of events,
                      to work with badly determined channels.
                  JA: Don't use BW for shat if mass > sqrt(s).
                  JA: Fixed insertion of colors for octet resonances decaying to 
                      octet+singlet (thanks Bogdan for finding this)

1.3.10 (23/08/11) OM: Update ALOHA version
                  OM: increase waiting time for jobs to write physically the results on
                      the disks (in ordre to reduce trouble on the cluster).

1.3.9 (01/08/11)  OM: Add a new model DY_SM (arXiv:1107.5830). Thanks to Neil
                      for the generation of the model 

1.3.8 (25/07/11)  JA: Replace the SM and HEFT models with latest versions using
                      the Wolfenstein parameterization for the CKM matrix.
                  JA: Implemented reading of the new UFO information about
                      coupling orders (order hierarchy and expansion_order).
                  JA: New "coupling order" specification WEIGHTED which checks
                      for  sum of coupling orders weighted by their hierarchy.
                  JA: Implemented optimal coupling orders for processes from any
                      model if no coupling orders specified.

1.3.7 (21/07/11)  JA: Fix makefiles for some v4 models that were forgotten
                      in v. 1.3.5

1.3.6 (18/07/11)  OM: Ensure that the new makefiles work on the web

1.3.5 (14/07/11): JA: New organization of make files, ensure that compilation works 
                      for all modes (with/without LHAPDF, static/dynamic, 
                      regular/gridpack) for both Linux and Mac OS X (be careful with 
                      dynamic libraries on Mac OS X though, since it seems that 
                      common blocks might not work properly)
                  JA: Fixed proper error messages and clean stop for compilation 
                      errors during MadEvent run.

1.3.4 (05/07/11): OM: More informative error message when a compilation error occurs

                      pythia8 process

1.3.2 (14/06/11): OM: Fix fortran output when a model is case sensitive 
                        (Bug if a coupling was depending of a case sensitive parameter)
                  SdV: Remove a annoying print in the new cuts (added in 1.3.0)
                  OM: Fix a compilation problem in the standalone cpp output

1.3.0 (02/06/11): JA: Allow for grouped subprocesses also for MG4 models
                  JA: Improved multiprocess diagram generation to reuse
                      diagrams for crossed processes
                  JA: Automatic optimization of order of particles in
                      multiparticle labels for optimal multiprocess generation
                  JA: Improved efficiency of identification of identical
                      matrix elements
                  JA: Improved identification of diagrams with identical
                      divergency structure for grouped subprocesses
                  JA: Included more fine-grained run options in the
                      run_card, including helicity summation options,
                      whether or not to set ptj and mjj automatically
                      based on xqcut, etc.
                  JA: Fixed some minor array limit and arithmetics warnings
                      for extreme decay and decay chain processes.
                  SdV: Added cuts on H_T(all jets, light and b)

1.2.4 (15/05/11): JA: Fixed long-standing bug in DECAY relating to
                      the cross section info in <init> block, and
                      fixed parameter reading for MG5 SM model.

1.2.3 (11/05/11): JA: Fixed problem with scale choice in processes with mixed 
                      QED/QCD orders, e.g. p p > t t~ QED=2. Note that this fix
                      doesn't work for p p > t t~ j j QED=4 which should still
                      be avoided.
                  JA: Added the ptllmin/max options in the default run_card.dat

1.2.2 (09/05/11): OM: fix ALOHA symmetries creating not gauge invariant result 
                      for scalar octet

1.2.1 (08/05/11): OM: reduce the quantity of RAM use by matrix.f

                  OM: add a check on the path for the validity of the model.pkl
                  JA: Fixed problem with combine_runs on certain compilers

1.1.2 (03/05/11): OM+JA: Fixed problem for models with multiple
                      interactions for the same set of particles,
                      introduced in v. 1.1.1
 
1.1.1 (02/05/11): JA: Replaced (slow) diagram symmetry determination by
                      evaluation with fast identification based on diagram tags.
                  JA: Replacing the "p=-p" id=0 vertex produced by diagram 
                      generation algorithm already in the diagram generation,
                      simplifying drawing, helas objects and color.
                  JA: Fixed compiler warnings for unary operator.
                  JA: Always set all coupling orders for diagrams
                      (needed for NLO implementations).
                  OM: Improved and more elegant "open" implementation for
                      the user interface.
                  OM: minor fixes related to checking the gauge

1.1.0 (21/04/11): JA: Removed hard limit on number of external particles in 
                      MadEvent, allowing for unlimited length decay chains there
                      (up to 14 final state particles successfully integrated).
                  JA: Improved helicity selection and automatic full helicity 
                      sum if needed. Optimization of run parameters.
                  JA: New flag in run_card.dat to decide whether basic cuts
                      are applied to decay products or not.
                  OM: Merged ALOHA calls for different lorentz structures 
                      with the same color structures, increasing the speed and 
                      efficiency of matrix element evaluations.
                  OM: Added new "open" command in command line interface,
                      allowing to open standard file types directly.
                      Automatically open crossx.html at launch.
                  JA: Fixed MadEvent bugs for multiparton processes with 
                      conflicting decays and some faulty array limits.
                  JA: Suppressed scary but irrelevant warnings for compiling 
                      2->1 and 1->2 processes in MadEvent.
                  JA: Pythia 8 output further optimized.
                  JA, OM: Several minor fixes relating to user interface etc.

1.0.0 (12/04/11): Official release of MadGraph 5. Some of the features:
                  - Complete FeynRules compatibility through the UFO interface
                  - Automatic writing of HELAS routines for any model in
                    Fortran, C++ or Python through ALOHA
                  - Matrix element output in Fortran, C++ or Python
                  - Output formats: MadEvent, Pythia 8, Standalone (Fortran/C++)
                  - Support for spin 0, 1/2, 1, 2 particles
                  - Support for color 1, 3, 6, 8
                  - Revamped MadEvent with improved subprocess directory 
                    organization and vastly increased speed and stability
                  - Unlimited length decay chains (up to 12 final state
                    particles tested with MadEvent, see v. 1.0.1)
                  - Process checks for new model implementations
                  - ...and much more (see paper "MadGraph 5: Going Beyond")
