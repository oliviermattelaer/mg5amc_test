Update notes for MadGraph 5 (in reverse time order)

1.4.4 (XX/XX/XX)  OM: Added a command: "output aloha" which allows to creates a 
       		      subset (or all) of the aloha routines linked to the
                      current model
                  OM: allow to choose the duration of the timer for the questions.
                      (via ./input/mg5_configuration.txt)
                  JA: Fixed LHAPDF functionality which was broken in v. 1.4.0
                  JA: Allow non-equal mixing angles in mssm restrict cards
                      (as needed for cards from some spectrum generators)
                  JA: Fixed script addmasses.py for complicated events such as
                      p p > t t~ + jets with decays of t and t~.

1.4.3 (08/03/12)  JA: Reintroduced the possibility to completely forbid
                      s-channel diagrams, using the $$ notation. Note that
                      this should be used with great care, since the result
                      is in general not gauge-invariant. It is in general
                      better to use the $ notation, forbidding only onshell
                      s-channel particles (the inverse of decay chains).
                  JA: Automatically ensure that ptj and mmjj are below xqcut
                      when xqcut > 0, since ptj or mmjj > xqcut ruins matching.
                  OM: Add LSF to the list of supported cluster (thanks to Alexis).
                  OM: change the param_card reader for the restrict file.
                      This allow to restrict model with 3 lha id (or more)
                      (thanks to Eduardo Ponton).
                  OM: forbids to run 'generate events' with python 2.4.
                  OM: Include the configuration file in the .tar.gz created on 
                      the web (thanks to Simon) .
                  OM: Fix a Mac specific problem for edition of Delphes card.
                      (thanks to Sho Iwamoto).
                  OM: ALOHA modifications:
                       - Change sign convention for Epsilon (matching FR choices)
                       - For Fermion vertex forces that _1 always returns the  
                         incoming fermion and _2 returns the outcoming fermion. 
                         (This modifies conjugate routine output)
                       - Change the order of argument for conjugate routine
                         to expect IO order of fermion in all cases.
                       Note that the two last modifications matches MG5 conventions
                       and that those modifications correct bugs for interactions
                       a) subject to conjugate routine (i.e. if the model has 
                          majorana)                       
                       b) containing fermion momentum dependencies in the Lorentz
                          structure  
                       All model included by default in MG5 (in particular sm/mssm)
                       were not affected by those mismatch of conventions.
                       (Thanks to Benjamin fuks) 
                  OM: make acceptance test more silent.  
                  OM: return the correct error message when a compilation occur. 
                  OM: some code re-factoring.

1.4.2 (16/02/12) JA: Ensure that matching works properly with > 9 final state
                      particles (by increasing a buffer size in event output)
                 OM: add a command "import banner" in order to run a full run
                      from a given banner.
                 OM: Fix the Bug #921487, fixing a problem with home made model
                      In the definition of Particle/Anti-Particle. (Thanks Ben)
                 OM: Fix a formatting problem in me5_configuration.txt 
                      (Bug #930101) Thanks to Arian
                 OM: allow to run ./bin/mg5 BANNER_PATH and
                      ./bin/mg5 PROC_CARD_V4_PATH
                 OM: Various small fixes concerning the stability of the html 
                      output.
                 OM: Changes the server to download td since cp3wks05 has an 
                      harddisk failures.

1.4.1 (06/02/12) OM: Fix the fermion flow check which was wrongly failing on 
                      some model  (Thanks to Benjamin)
                 OM: Improve run organization efficiency (which speeds up the 
                      code on cluster) (Thanks to Johan)
                 OM: More secure html output (Thanks to Simon)

1.4.0 (04/02/12) OM: New user interface for the madevent run. Type:
                      1) (from madevent output) ./bin/madevent
                      2) (from MG5 command line) launch [MADEVENT_PATH] -i
                      This interface replaces various script like refine, 
                      survey, combine, run_..., rm_run, ...
                      The script generate_events still exists but now calls
                       ./bin/madevent. 
                 OM: For MSSM model, convert param_card to SLAH1. This card is
                      converted to SLAH2 during the MadEvent run since the UFO 
                      model uses SLAH2. This allows to use Pythia 6,
                      as well as having a coherent definition for the flavor.
                 JA+OM: For decay width computations, the launch command in 
                      addition to compute the width, creates a new param_card 
                      with the width set to the associated values, and with the 
                      Branching ratio associated (usefull for pythia). 
                 NOTE: This param_card makes sense for future run ONLY if all 
                      relevant decay are generated.
                 EXAMPLE: (after launch bin/mg5):
                       import model sm-full
                       generate t > b w+
                       define all = p b b~ l+ l- ta+ ta- vl vl~
                       add process w+ > all all
                       add process z > all all
                       define v = z w+ w-
                       add process h > all all
                       add process h > v v, v > all all
                       output
                       launch
                 OM: change output pythia8 syntax: If a path is specified this 
                      is considered as the output directory.
                 OM: Change the path of the madevent output files. This allows 
                      to run pythia/pgs/delphes mulitple times for the same set 
                      of events (with different pythia/... parameters).
                 OM: Madevent output is now insensitive to the relative path
                      to pythia-pgs, delphes, ... In consequence you don't need
                      anymore to have your directory at the same level as 
                      Template directory. 
                 OM: MadEvent checks that the param_card is coherent with the 
                      restriction used during the model generation. 
                 OM: Model restrictions will now also force opposite number to 
                      match (helpfull for constraining to rotation matrix).  
                 OM: Change the import command. It's now allowed to omit the 
                      type of import. The type is guessed automaticaly. 
                      This is NOT allowed on the web.
                 OM: Add a check that the fermion flow is coherent with the 
                      Lorentz structure associates to the vertex.
                 OM: Add a check that the color representation is coherent. 
                      This allow to detect/fix various problem linked
                      to some new models created by FR and SARAH.
                 OM: Change the default fortran compiler to gfortran.
                 OM: Add the possibility to force which fortran compiler will
                      be used, either via the configuration file or via the set 
                      command.
                 OM: Add the possibility to bypass the automatic opening of 
                      the web browser (via the configuration file: 
                      ./input/mg5_configuration.txt )
                 OM: add 'save options' command to save the current configuration 
                      in the configuration file. 
                 OM: Change the scheme of questions when running madevent and 
                      allow to specify in the command interface if you
                      want to run pythia/pgs/...
                      Allow to put the answers to the questions in the 
                      proc_card.dat.
                 OM: Add options for the display command:
                      a) display options: return the current option value. 
                        i.e. those set via the set command and/or via the 
                        configuration file
                      b) display variable NAME: return the current string 
                        representation of NAME and/or self.NAME .
                      c) display coupling_order: return the coupling orders with
                        their associated weight (for automatic order restriction)
                      d) display couplings now returns the list of all couplings
                        with the associated expression
                      e) display interactions [PART1] [PART2] [PART3] ...
                         display all interactions containing the particles set
                         in arguments 
                 OM: New Python script for the creation of the various html pages.
                      This Requires less disk access for the generation of the files.
                 OM: Modify error treatment, especially for Invalid commands
                      and Configuration problems.
                 JA: Ensure that we get zero cross section if we have
                      non-parton initial states with proton/antiproton beams
                 OM: Improve cluster support. MadEvent now supports PBS/Condor/SGE
                      Thanks to Arian Abrahantes for the SGE implementation.
                 OM: Improve auto-completion (better output/dealing with multi line/...)
                 OM: Improve the parallel suite and change the release script to run
                      some of the parallel tests. This ensures even higher stability 
                      of the  code for the future releases.
                 JA: Changed the way gridpacks work: Set granularity to 1
                      (so randomly select channels only if they should generate 
                      less than 1 event), but allowing channels to run down to a single
                      iteration. This removes all old problems with increased
                      variance for small channels in the gridpacks, while giving 
                      even faster event generation.

                 Thanks to Johan Alwall, Sho Iwamoto for all the important 
                 testing/bug reports.


1.3.33 (01/01/12) JA: Revisited colors for propagators in addmothers.f
                      to ensure that propagators in color flow
                      violating processes get the correct color
                      from initial state particles (thanks to
                      Michele Gabusi for forcing me to do this).

1.3.32 (21/12/11) JA: Fixed a bug in the PDF reweighting routine,
                      which caused skewed eta distributions for
                      matched samples with pdfwgt=T. Thanks to Giulio
                      Lenzi for finding this.

1.3.30 (18/11/11) OM: Fix a bug for the instalation of pythia-pgs on a 64 bit
                      UNIX machine.
                  OM: If ROOTSYS is define but root in the PATH, add it 
                      automatically in create_matching_plots.sh

1.3.28 (14/11/11) OM+JA: Fix special case when Lorentz structure combining
                      two different Majorana particles depends on the
                      incoming/outgoing status of the Majorana particles
                      (needed for MSSM with Goldstino).
                  JA: Fixed problem with colors in addmothers.f for complicated

                      amplitudes that should not be flagged as
                      mirrored were flagged as mirrored). Thanks
                      Marco Zaro for reporting this!
                  JA: Fix another problem getting enough events in
                      gridpack mode (it was not completely fixed in
                      v. 1.3.24). Thanks Alexis!
                  JA: Added "!" comments for all parameters in the default
                      run_card, since apparently this is still needed
                      for g77 to correctly read the parameters.
 
1.3.26 (31/10/11) JA: Fix color setting in MadEvent event file for
                      multiparticle vertices, which was not taken into
                      account in the upgrade in v. 1.3.18

1.3.24 (22/10/11) JA: Fix problem with getting enough events in gridpack
                      mode (this was broken in v. 1.3.11 when we moved
                      from events to luminocity in refine). Thanks to
                      Alexis Kalogeropoulos.

1.3.23 (19/10/11) JA: Allow user to set scales using setscales.f again

                     "make" command is not installed on the system.
 
1.3.22 (12/10/11) JA: Fixed another bug (also introduced in 1.3.18), which 
                      could give the wrong ordering between the s-channel 
                      propagators for certain multiprocess cases (this
                      also lead to a hard stop, so don't worry, if you get 
                      your events, the bug doesn't affect you). Sorry about
                      that, this is what happens when you add a lot of
                      new functionality...

1.3.21 (12/10/11) OM: Add a new command: install.
                      This allow to install quite easily different package

                      introduced in 1.3.18.

1.3.18 (04/10/11) JA: Use model information to determine color of particles
                      for reweighting and propagator color info.
                  JA: Changed the definition of "forbidden s-channels"
                      denoted by "$" to exclude on-shell s-channels while
                      keeping all diagrams (i.e., complemetary to the decay
                      chain formalism). This reduces the problems with 
                      gauge invariance compared to previously.
                      "Onshell" is as usual defined by the "bwcutoff" flag 
                      in the run_card.dat.
                  JA: Enable proper 4-flavor matching (such as gg>hbb~+jets)
                      Note that you need the Pythia/PGS package v. 2.1.9 or 
                      later to use with 4F matching.
                      Changes include: alpha_s reweighting also for b vertices,
                      new scale treatment (mu_F for pp>hbb~ is (pT_b^max*m_Th)),
                      no clustering of gluons to final-state massive particles
                      in MadEvent.
                  JA: Ensure that factorization scale settings and matching works
                      also in singlet t-channel exchange processes like
                      single top and VBF. The dynamic factorization
                      scale is given by the pT of the scattered quark
                      (on each side of the event).
                Note: You need the Pythia/PGS package v. 2.1.10 or later
                      to use with VBF matching, to ensure that both radiated
                      and scattered partons are treated correctly
                      - scattered partons need to be excluded from the matching,
                      since their pT can be below QCUT. An even better
                      treatment would require to individually shower and match
                      the two sides in Pythia, which is not presently possible.
                Note: In the matched 4-flavor process p p > t b~ j $ w+ w- t~ +
                      p p > t b~ j j $ w+ w- t~, there is an admixture
                      of t-channel single top (with up to 1 radiated jet) 
                      and s-channel single top (with up to 2 radiated jets). 
                      In this case, the automatic determination of maximum 
                      multiplicity sample doesn't work (since max in the file 
                      will be 2 jets, but for t-channel max is 1 jet).
                      So MAXJETS=1 must be specified in the pythia_card.dat.
                  JA: Fixed pdf reweighting for matching, which due to a mistake
                      had never been activated.
                  JA: Improved phase space integration presetting further by 
                      taking into account special cuts like xpt, ht etc.
                  JA: Introduce new convention for invariant mass cuts
                      - if max < min, exclude intermediate range
                      (allows to exclude W/Z dijet resonances in VBF processes)

1.3.17 (30/09/11) OM: Fix a crash created by ALOHA when it tries to create the full
                      set of ALOHA routines (pythia8 output only).

1.3.16 (11/09/11) JA: Fixed the problem from 1.3.12.

1.3.15 (09/09/11) OM: remove the fix of 1.3.12
                      (No events in output for some given processes)

1.3.14 (08/09/11) OM: Fix a bug in the RS model introduced in 1.3.8

1.3.13 (05/09/11) JA: Fixed bug with cut_decays=F which removed cuts also for
                      non-decay products in certain channels if there is
                      a forced decay present. Note that this does not affect
                      xqcut, only pt, minv and eta cuts.
                  JA: If non-zero phase space cutoff, don't use minimum of
                      1 GeV (this allows to go to e.g. 2m_e invariant mass for
                      \gamma* > e+ e-).

1.3.12 (01/09/11) JA: Fixed problem with decay chains when different decays
                      result in identical final states, such as
                      p p > go go, (go > b1/b1~ b/b~, b1/b1~ > b/b~ n1)
                      (only one of the decay chains was chosen, instead of
                      all 3 combinations (b1,b1), (b1,b1~), (b1~,b1~))
                  JA: Allow for overall orders also with grouped subprocesses
                  JA: Ensure that only leading color flows are included in event
                      output (so no singlet flows from color octets).
                  JA: Fixed small bug in fermion flow determination for multifermion
                      vertices.

1.3.11 (26/08/11) JA: Improved precision of "survey" by allowing 4th and 5th 
                      iteration if accuracy after 3 iterations < 10%.
                  JA: Subdivide BW in phase space integration for conflicting BWs 
                      also for forced decays, to improve generation with large
                      bwcutoff in e.g. W+ W- production with decays.
                  JA: Do refine using luminocity instead of number of events,
                      to work with badly determined channels.
                  JA: Don't use BW for shat if mass > sqrt(s).
                  JA: Fixed insertion of colors for octet resonances decaying to 
                      octet+singlet (thanks Bogdan for finding this)

1.3.10 (23/08/11) OM: Update ALOHA version
                  OM: increase waiting time for jobs to write physically the results on
                      the disks (in ordre to reduce trouble on the cluster).

1.3.9 (01/08/11)  OM: Add a new model DY_SM (arXiv:1107.5830). Thanks to Neil 
                      for the generation of the model 

1.3.8 (25/07/11)  JA: Replace the SM and HEFT models with latest versions using
                      the Wolfenstein parameterization for the CKM matrix.
                  JA: Implemented reading of the new UFO information about
                      coupling orders (order hierarchy and expansion_order).
                  JA: New "coupling order" specification WEIGHTED which checks
                      for  sum of coupling orders weighted by their hierarchy.
                  JA: Implemented optimal coupling orders for processes from any
                      model if no coupling orders specified.

1.3.7 (21/07/11)  JA: Fix makefiles for some v4 models that were forgotten
                      in v. 1.3.5

1.3.6 (18/07/11)  OM: Ensure that the new makefiles work on the web

1.3.5 (14/07/11): JA: New organization of make files, ensure that compilation works 
                      for all modes (with/without LHAPDF, static/dynamic, 
                      regular/gridpack) for both Linux and Mac OS X (be careful with 
                      dynamic libraries on Mac OS X though, since it seems that 
                      common blocks might not work properly)
                  JA: Fixed proper error messages and clean stop for compilation 
                      errors during MadEvent run.

1.3.4 (05/07/11): OM: More informative error message when a compilation error occurs

                      no 3-vertex-only diagrams
                  JA (by OM): More informative error when trying to generate invalid 
                      pythia8 process

1.3.2 (14/06/11): OM: Fix fortran output when a model is case sensitive 
                        (Bug if a coupling was depending of a case sensitive parameter)
                  SdV: Remove a annoying print in the new cuts (added in 1.3.0)
                  OM: Fix a compilation problem in the standalone cpp output

                  JA: Improved multiprocess diagram generation to reuse
                      diagrams for crossed processes
                  JA: Automatic optimization of order of particles in
                      multiparticle labels for optimal multiprocess generation
                  JA: Improved efficiency of identification of identical
                      matrix elements
                  JA: Improved identification of diagrams with identical
                      divergency structure for grouped subprocesses
                  JA: Included more fine-grained run options in the
                      run_card, including helicity summation options,
                      whether or not to set ptj and mjj automatically
                      based on xqcut, etc.
                  JA: Fixed some minor array limit and arithmetics warnings
                      for extreme decay and decay chain processes.
                  SdV: Added cuts on H_T(all jets, light and b)
                  OM: Fixed minor bug related to cluster option in launch

1.2.4 (15/05/11): JA: Fixed long-standing bug in DECAY relating to
                      the cross section info in <init> block, and
                      fixed parameter reading for MG5 SM model.

1.2.3 (11/05/11): JA: Fixed problem with scale choice in processes with mixed 
                      QED/QCD orders, e.g. p p > t t~ QED=2. Note that this fix
                      doesn't work for p p > t t~ j j QED=4 which should still
                      be avoided.
                  JA: Added the ptllmin/max options in the default run_card.dat

                      making a release

                  JA: Fixed problem with combine_runs on certain compilers

1.1.2 (03/05/11): OM+JA: Fixed problem for models with multiple
                      interactions for the same set of particles,
                      introduced in v. 1.1.1
 
1.1.1 (02/05/11): JA: Replaced (slow) diagram symmetry determination by
                      evaluation with fast identification based on diagram tags.
                  JA: Replacing the "p=-p" id=0 vertex produced by diagram 
                      generation algorithm already in the diagram generation,
                      simplifying drawing, helas objects and color.
                  JA: Fixed compiler warnings for unary operator.
                  JA: Always set all coupling orders for diagrams
                      (needed for NLO implementations).
                  OM: Improved and more elegant "open" implementation for
                      the user interface.
                  OM: minor fixes related to checking the gauge

1.1.0 (21/04/11): JA: Removed hard limit on number of external particles in 
                      MadEvent, allowing for unlimited length decay chains there
                      (up to 14 final state particles successfully integrated).
                  JA: Improved helicity selection and automatic full helicity 
                      sum if needed. Optimization of run parameters.
                  JA: New flag in run_card.dat to decide whether basic cuts
                      are applied to decay products or not.
                  OM: Merged ALOHA calls for different lorentz structures 
                      with the same color structures, increasing the speed and 
                      efficiency of matrix element evaluations.
                  OM: Added new "open" command in command line interface,
                      allowing to open standard file types directly.
                      Automatically open crossx.html at launch.
                  JA: Fixed MadEvent bugs for multiparton processes with 
                      conflicting decays and some faulty array limits.
                  JA: Suppressed scary but irrelevant warnings for compiling 
                      2->1 and 1->2 processes in MadEvent.
                  JA: Pythia 8 output further optimized.
