<h2>Dark Matter Processes</h2> 
 
This page contains the production of Dark Matter via new <ei>s</ei>-channel 
mediators.  Currently only vector-like mediator i.e. <ei>Z'^0</ei> for 
Dirac DM is implemented. Note that the mediator in this case carries 
the PDG id 55. 
 
<h3><ei>Z'^0</ei></h3> 
 
This group currently contains only one subprocess. 
 
<flag name="DM:ffbar2Zp2XX" default="off"> 
Scattering <ei>f fbar &rarr;Z'^0 &rarr; X Xbar</ei>. 
Code 6001. 
</flag> 
 
<p/> 
The couplings of the <ei>Z'^0</ei> to quarks and leptons are be 
assumed universal, i.e. generation-independent. Currently only vector 
couplings are implemented.  The choice of fixed axial and vector 
couplings implies a resonance width that increases linearly with the 
<ei>Z'^0</ei> mass. Note that cross sections strongly depend on the 
choice of mediator and Dark Matter masses. 
 
<p/> 
Here are the couplings 
 
<parm name="Zp:vq" default="0.1"> 
vector coupling of quarks. 
</parm> 
 
<parm name="Zp:vX" default="0.1"> 
vector coupling of the Dark Matter <ei>X</ei> particles. 
</parm>
