Installation instructions:

1) Install PYTHIA.

   Some installation scripts for PYTHIA and
   its dependences can be found at slac.stanford.edu/~prestel/DIRE .
   The most complete option would be to download an installation script

   wget slac.stanford.edu/~prestel/DIRE/installHEPTOOLS.sh

   making it executable

   chmod +x installHEPTOOLS.sh

   and executing the script. This will install new copies of Pythia and all
   dependences. If you want to proceed with this convenient (yet rather
   non-minimal), and the installation finished correctly, you can directly 
   start experimenting with the code (see e.g. step 6) )

2) Download DIRE from
   https://direforpythia.hepforge.org
   by e.g. using

   wget http://www.hepforge.org/archive/direforpythia/DIRE-1.500.tar.gz

3) Untar the DIRE tarball in the PYTHIA examples
   directory of your PYTHIA installation directory
   (e.g. /some/path/share/Pythia8/examples/)
   e.g. by executing

   tar xvfz DIRE-1.500.tar.gz

4) cd into the DIRE-1.500 directory

5) Type
 
   make dire00

   to compile the simplest DIRE main program.
   Note that the dire01, dire02 and dire03 main program link
   against HEPMC2, which means PYTHIA has to be configured to
   support this. The main program dire04 links against ProMC.

6) Run with

   ./dire00

   This will produce lepton scattering events at LEP.
   The remaining example programs need an input file with settings
   to run smoothly. An example would be to run with

   make dire05; ./dire05 myinput.cmnd

   where myinput.cmnd is an appropriate input file
   (examples could be dis.cmnd, lhc.cmnd and lep.cmnd)

7) Compile dire01 and run with

   ./dire01 myinput.cmnd myoutput.hepmc

   where myinput.cmnd is an input file and
   myoutput.hepmc will be filled with HepMC event output.
